# MMM-SG-Transport
MagicMirrorÂ² Module - Local Transport in Singapore

**Broken as at 31 Oct 2017, does not support LTA DataMall v2 API.**

**LTA DataMall v1 API was deprecated on 1 Aug 2017**

This module displays data about bus arrivals. More than one bus stop can be specified.

This module aims to provide the most compact display possible with multiple bus stops.

Data is sourced from [LTA DataMall](https://www.mytransport.sg/content/mytransport/home/dataMall.html), you need to get your own API key here.

This module works with [MagicMirror<sup>2</sup>](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror) project by [MichMich](https://github.com/MichMich/)
